# Blockchain-Based Secure Framework for Smart City Applications

![Project Banner](project-banner.png)

## Project Overview
The Blockchain-Based Secure Framework for Smart City Applications is a comprehensive platform designed to provide secure and efficient functionality for smart city applications. It incorporates a consortium blockchain, multiple layers of security, and modern technologies to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity within the smart city ecosystem.

## Vision
Our vision is to create a robust and reliable framework that empowers smart cities with secure, scalable, and innovative applications. We aim to foster trust among stakeholders, protect sensitive data, and contribute to the development of smarter, safer, and more sustainable cities.

## Methodology
Our project follows a systematic approach to achieve our vision:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: We thoroughly analyze the requirements of secure smart city applications to identify key features and security considerations.
2. **Design**: We design a consortium blockchain architecture, develop encryption and hashing algorithms, and establish multiple layers of security for data protection.
3. **Implementation**: We implement the frontend using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend utilizes MongoDB, Node.js, and Express for building robust APIs and secure database connectivity.
4. **Testing and Refinement**: We rigorously test the system to ensure its functionality, security, and performance. We iterate and refine the implementation based on testing results.
5. **Documentation**: We provide comprehensive documentation, including the project overview, architecture, security measures, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

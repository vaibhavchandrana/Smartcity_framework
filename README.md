# Blockchain-Based Secure Framework for Smart City Applications

This project aims to develop a secure framework for smart city applications using blockchain technology. It provides a reliable and robust platform that ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity within the smart city ecosystem. By leveraging a consortium blockchain, strong encryption algorithms, and multiple layers of security, the framework offers a secure foundation for building smart city applications.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The project includes a beautiful and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with smart city applications.

- **Security Measures**: The framework implements multiple layers of security, including secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, encrypted transactions, and digital signature verification.

- **Data Integrity**: Robust cryptographic algorithms are employed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of exchanged information, preventing unauthorized tampering.

- **Scalable and Reliable Infrastructure**: The project provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure capable of handling the growing demands of smart city applications, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Search and Filtering Functionality**: Users can easily search for specific information and apply filters to find relevant data within the system.

- **Collaboration and Innovation**: The framework encourages collaboration and innovation among developers, researchers, and stakeholders, fostering the advancement of smart city technologies.

## Technology Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: MongoDB, Node.js, Express
- Blockchain Development: JavaScript for designing and implementing the consortium blockchain from scratch
- Security: Custom algorithms for hashing, consensus, encryption, and decryption
- API Development: RESTful APIs for functionalities such as JWT authentication, searching, and filtering
- Cloud Integration: Integration with a reliable and resilient cloud database infrastructure
- User Interface: Modern UI design using React and Tailwind CSS




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
